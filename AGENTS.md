# Python AI Agents Demos

This repository contains examples of several popular Python AI agent frameworks,
in both english and spanish.

All examples should be the same functionally across english and spanish,
with the prompts and data in the respective language.

All examples should support Azure OpenAI, GitHub Models, and Ollama.

When running Python examples, always run them from inside the .venv virtual environment.
You can activate it with:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Or you can run python commands inside the .venv with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python <your_script.py>
```

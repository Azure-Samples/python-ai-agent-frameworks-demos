This country gave us birth, nurtured us, but what did it ask in return? Just our honesty, our hard work, our contribution. But what are we doing? We are bounded by the chains of unemployment, being abroad in search of opportunities. We are trapped by the selfish games of political parties. Corruption has woven a web that is extinguishing the life of our future. Youth, rise! Our ancestors shed their blood to give us this nation. We cannot tell it, we cannot lose it. King Mirendra once said, even if I die, shall my country live on!
